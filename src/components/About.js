        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Perfume, the olfactory art that dances through history and cultures, is a blend of fragrant essential oils, aroma compounds, and solvents, designed to create a pleasing scent for humans, animals, or objects. The journey of perfume stretches back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. Early perfumes were crafted from natural ingredients such as flowers, herbs, and resins, and were used in religious rituals, burial ceremonies, and for personal grooming.</p>
